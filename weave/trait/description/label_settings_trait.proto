   *  @brief
   *    Label
   *
   *  A Weave Common trait that allows users to decorate or augment a
   *  resource with a descriptive name or label to help them
   *  differentiate one device resource from another in a way that is
   *  meaningful and familiar to them, as a setting.
   *
   *  Each and every physical resource within the Works with Nest
   *  ecosystem has a location it is installed in or affixed to. User
   *  interfaces will group and organize the device resource by its
   *  localized location such as:
   *
   *    - Hallway
   *      o Nest Protect
   *      o Nest Protect
   *
   *    - Bedroom
   *      o Nest Protect
   *
   *    - Sauna
   *      o Nest Learning Thermostat
   *
   *    - Bat Cave
   *      o Nest Learning Thermostat
   *
   *  In some instances, those locations are large enough to encompass
   *  multiple products of the same type, such as two Nest Protects at
   *  the end of a very long hallway or corridor. To disambiguate
   *  multiple device resources in the same physical location or space,
   *  additional decoration may be necessary.
   *
   *  The example device resources above can be decorated to
   *  disambiguate them:
   *
   *    - Hallway
   *      o Nest Protect (Left)
   *      o Nest Protect (Right)
   *
   *    - Bedroom
   *      o Nest Protect (Moe's)
   *
   *    - Sauna
   *      o Nest Learning Thermostat (Outdoor)
   *
   *    - Bat Cave
   *      o Nest Learning Thermostat (Bruce's under the Waterfall)
   *
   *  Where the parenthetical '()' content represents the additional description
   *  provided by this trait.
   *
