 * @brief
 *   This specifies a Weave Common trait that generalizes

 *   has available. Localizations, in this context, are the

 *   interfaces into a different language for a specific country or
 *   region.
 *
 * @note
 *   This deprecates the Available Locales property of the Locale trait.
 *   This trait should be used, in conjunction with the Locale
 *   Capabilities trait, in all new resource designs.
